The apparel recognition app trains a neural network model to classify images of clothing such as sneakers, shirts, boots.

In this application, a deep neural network model has been created to classify clothing images.
Tensorflow and Keras libraries were used.
A data set called Fashion Mnist containing 70.000 gray-tone images in 10 categories was used. 
The Fashion Mnist dataset can be accessed directly from Tensorflow.
